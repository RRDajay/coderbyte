my Coderbyte Challenge submissions
Hello!

This is simply an excerpt of my subbissions to the coderbyte challenge.

The ones I've submitted here on Github is the ones I feel can be of interrest for the public, 
and they all should be understandable for a programmers mind.

If you don't, please ask, and I will explain/comment the code as good and understandable as I can.
